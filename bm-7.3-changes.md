Q: Are there any changes for BM in 7.3? I thought there was a 10% buff?

No. In 7.2.5, our overall damage was given a flat 6% increase as the
"Beast Mastery spec." In a PTR build for 7.3, 4% was added to several
abilities, but has since been reverted.

Additionally, someone on the internet datamined and believes there was a 6% damage nerf to Stomp. This has not been confirmed, and is probably an inconsequential amount that no one will actually notice.
