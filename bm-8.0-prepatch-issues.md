# Command Pet Doesn't Work

If you're using The Apex Predator's Claw legendary ring, Command Pet does not work. You need to drag the abilities from your spellbook to your action bar manually. It doesn't appear that macros work either.

# Animal Companion Dies, Doesn't Do Much Damage, Etc.

Both popular Beast Mastery guides, [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/beast-mastery-hunter-pve-dps-spec-builds-pet-talents) and [Wowhead](www.wowhead.com/beast-mastery-hunter-talent-guide) do *not* recommend using Animal Companion at this time. The talent is prone to pet AI issues and tuning issues as it wasn't a straight up reimplementation of the Legion artifact weapon pet, Hati.
