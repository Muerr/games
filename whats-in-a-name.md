Muerr is short for Muerrischer, which is the English spelling of Mürrischer.

Older MMOs didn't allow special characters, so I couldn't use `ü`. And they also didn't have tab-completion for whispers/tells, so typing Muerrischer was annoying for people. This is great if you're grumpy about getting random tells, but not so great when you want to chat with friends in a game.
