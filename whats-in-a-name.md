Muerr is short for Muerrischer, which is the English spelling of Mürrischer. Muerr rhymes with Pure, not Where, btw. 

Older MMOs didn't allow special characters, so I couldn't use `ü`. And they also didn't have tab-completion for whispers/tells, so typing Muerrischer was annoying for people. This is great if you're grumpy about getting random tells, but not so great when you want to chat with friends in a game.

The short version of the backstory is I was known for being Grumpy* at work many years ago. However, I wanted something that "worked" better for English-language based fantasy games, so I went about translating it in different languages (thanks, Google). German sounded the most interesting to me, and here we are.

*Note that I am *not* a grumpy person so much anymore, but I've been using the name for 20+ years now.
