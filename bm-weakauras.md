I maintain several weakauras on [wago.io](https://wago.io/p/Muerr). Of note for Beast Mastery Hunters is the [full collection](https://wago.io/NJJSRp8df). Enjoy!

(Note: Beast Cleave meows, some people don't like that)

Asakawa made a dope looking Frenzy weakaura bar you might like [here](https://wago.io/FrenzyTracker).
